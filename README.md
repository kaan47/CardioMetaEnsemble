# CardioMetaEnsemble
State-of-the-art ensemble and meta-learning Python models for precise cardiovascular risk prediction. Features modular and reproducible pipelines, rigorous evaluation including ROC/AUC, and adaptable workflows for clinical dataset analysis and translational research applications.

## Dataset

This repository uses a publicly available dataset:  

- **Heart Disease Dataset – Comprehensive**  
  Source: [IEEE DataPort](https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/heart-disease-dataset-comprehensive)  
  Description: Description: This dataset combines five heart disease cohorts over 11 common features, which can be used to build predictive machine learning models for early-stage heart disease detection. Its use allows for benchmarking the performance of analytical methods against other studies conducted on the same dataset. 

## Files

- `EnsembleMetaCardio.ipynb` – Main Jupyter notebook implementing ensemble and meta-learning approaches  
- `README.md` – Project description and documentation  

## Usage

The analysis is implemented in a single Jupyter Notebook: `EnsembleMetaCardio.ipynb`.  
To explore the workflow:  

1. Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.  
2. Follow the step-by-step sections to:  
   - Train multiple ensemble and meta-learning models  
   - Perform model evaluation using standard metrics (e.g., ROC, AUC, accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)  
   - Generate visualizations including ROC curves, learning curves, and comparative performance plots
